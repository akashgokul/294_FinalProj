# Lane Detection using Vanishing Points
### This repository provide the code for our CS294-167 final project: Lane Detection using Vanishing Points. Through the course of this experiment, we primarily used Google Colab. The Colab links for our naive one-task network can be found: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1g2PUqlCkE_qzPQWWJgNnLV2bGf2KLAu_?usp=sharing. Additionally, the naive one-task network code on this file can be run by executing the main.py file.
